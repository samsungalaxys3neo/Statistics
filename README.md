## Statistics Blog

This repository collects a series of statistics assignments developed as a web-based academic project. 

The material explores fundamental and applied concepts of probability and statistics through a combination of theoretical reasoning and computational experimentation, with particular attention to random phenomena, distributions, and stochastic behavior. 

Several concepts are investigated via simulations and simple cryptographic and adversarial models, as well as through the study of random processes, convergence properties, and probabilistic approximations. 

The project is implemented as a lightweight website using HTML for structure, JavaScript to support simulations and dynamic computations, and basic CSS for visual clarity. Its purpose is to provide an interactive environment for understanding statistical concepts beyond purely analytical treatment, emphasizing intuition, experimentation, and algorithmic thinking.
